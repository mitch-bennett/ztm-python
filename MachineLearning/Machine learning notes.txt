# Machine learning notes

Starts with AI (artificial intelligence)
-currently have limited AI, only do a specific thing well
-moving towards general AI

Machine learning is working to get machines to do things without specific commands
Deep learning is one way to implement algorithm in machine learning

Data science overlaps with Machine Learning knowledge

Machine learning:
instead of giving input to calculate output of a function, give input and expected output
The machine will figure out what the function is (model)
all about predicting results with incoming Data

Supervised: incoming data has categories (labeled test data)
-classification, regression

Unsupervised: unlabeled data for machine to create categories/groups
-clustering, association rule learning

Reinforcement: teaching machines through trial & error (reward vs punishment)
-skill acquisition, real time learning
