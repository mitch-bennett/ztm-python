hashing notes:

-a hash function generates a value of fixed length for the input
-the function is one way; don't know input if you have output
-same string will always return same hash (idempotent)
-ex MD5, SHA1, SHA256

-common usage in hash table is to take key and hash, then take the hash and assign map to an address (aka store in memory)
-however, increasingly adding length to a dictionary will slow performance (assume O1 'Big oh' notation with something like MD5)
