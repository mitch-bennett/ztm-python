server contains html (text/content), css (styling), js (functionality/behavior)
make a request through http/https to server, get files back

--VENV--
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
create a virtual environment for everything
when specifying, the second term defines the location
if the folder already exists, the 'venv' files are placed directly in that folder
e.g. 'python -m venv webserver' places the bin, include, lib files directly in webserver, not a different 'venv' folder

--running FLASK--
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
flask is a framework (somewhat like a library) but with pre-built tools and security
flask is more of a micro-framework and faster/clean compared to django (which is a big kitchen)
read through quickstart docs

Need to add environment variable for flask app (to venv)
export FLASK_APP=hello.py

Option to add debug environment variable. automatically will update server on file save (don't need flask run)
export FLASK_ENV=development

then 'flask run' will run on localhost of machine
you can open this in web browser as well
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

--running HTML--
flask comes with render templates, which can return an html file
this by default looks for a folder called 'templates'
create this directory and move html files here
this way, can create multiple different routes to different html files

--using scripting files--
similarly, store 'static' files in a directory called 'static'
